# Commit Message Rules

## Format

```
<type>: <subject>

1.<reason> → <change>
2.<reason> → <change>
3.<reason> → <change>
```

- **Header**: must include type and subject, max 50 characters.
- **Second line**: blank (required).
- **Body** (line 3+): numbered items. Each item states the reason first, then the change. Keep each item under 50 characters.
- Body is optional for trivial changes.
